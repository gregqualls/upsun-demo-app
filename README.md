The application features a modern, responsive UI with per-application resource controls and monitoring:

- **Per-App Resource Controls**: Individual sliders for each business application
- **Business-Focused Metrics**: Processing, Storage, Traffic, Orders, and Completions
- **Real-time Status Dashboard**: Live health checks and status indicators for each app
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live updates of resource consumption and performance
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes
- **Demo-Optimized UI**: Large, clear elements perfect for screen recording and presentations
- **Realistic Microservices**: Each app behaves like a real business service

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### v1 - Business Microservices Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS with per-app resource controls
- **API Gateway**: FastAPI service for orchestration and resource management
- **Business Applications** (4 configurable microservices):
  - **User Management**: User account and authentication services
  - **Payment Processing**: Financial transaction handling
  - **Inventory System**: Product and stock management
  - **Notification Center**: Communication and alerting

### Resource Management

Each business application includes:
- **Processing**: CPU-intensive tasks and calculations
- **Storage**: Memory-intensive operations and data structures

**Simplified Control**: The system now uses a streamlined 2-slider interface (Processing/Storage) for easier demo control while maintaining realistic resource simulation.

**Service Communication**: All services communicate via HTTP using Upsun's internal relationships (`http://service-name.internal`), with centralized resource management through a shared library.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.11+
   - Node.js 20+
   - Git

   **Note**: The script automatically creates a Python virtual environment to avoid system package conflicts.

2. **Start all services locally**:
   ```bash
   ./start-local.sh
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8004

### Upsun Deployment

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Upsun account and organization
   - Upsun CLI installed

2. **Deploy to Upsun**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new project
   upsun project:create upsun-demo-app
   
   # Deploy the application
   upsun app:deploy
   ```

3. **Access your deployed application**:
   - Frontend: `https://rearchitect-ljoo54q-ckxfak37732ke.ch-1.platformsh.site/`
   - API Gateway: `https://api.rearchitect-ljoo54q-ckxfak37732ke.ch-1.platformsh.site/`

**Note**: The application uses Upsun's internal relationships for service communication. Services communicate via `http://service-name.internal` URLs, which are automatically configured by Upsun based on the relationships defined in `.upsun/config.yaml`.
