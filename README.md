### Adding New Services
1. Create a new directory with your service code
2. Update the API Gateway service URLs
3. Add the service to deployment instructions

### Customizing Resource Simulation
- Modify the worker functions in each service
- Adjust the resource calculation algorithms
- Add new resource types or metrics
- Customize the UI components
